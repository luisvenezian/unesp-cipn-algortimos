Study codes written during my masters degree course of natural computing:

1. Notebook named "otimizacao" is a iterative approach of two AI algorithms for optimization and search: Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing. It shows the algorithm step by step using matplotlib.

2. Files choromosome.py, chromosome_bistring.py and genetic_algorithm runs a genetic approach for identifying a bitstring 111101101111 that represents the number 1 in a 3 columns and 4 rows matrix. The code is inspired in parts of the book Classic Computer Science Problems in Python by David Kopec.
